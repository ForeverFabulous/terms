<p><strong>VERGE TERMS OF SERVICE</strong><br>
Last Updated: 28/09/2018</p>
<p>These terms of service (“Terms”) apply to your access and use of VERGE (the “Service”). Please read them carefully.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Accepting these Terms</strong><br>
If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all the terms.<br>
If you don’t agree to all the terms below, please do not use the Service.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Changes to these Terms</strong><br>
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason.</p>
<p>Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective [DAY WHEN ALL EDITS TAKE EFFECT] after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check VERGE for changes to these Terms.</p>
<p>If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong><br>
From time to time, we may provide you with links to third party websites or services that we do not own or control.  Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party.<br>
Your use of such third-party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party’s own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third-party application, website or service that you visit or use.<br>
Using third-party utilities of any kind to get any sort of advantage is not okay.<br>
This includes things like macro programs, aim-assist programs, time scale modification, and so on.<br>
If a program is doing something to help you play the game that you should be doing yourself, it isn’t okay and will lead to<br>
restriction of your account.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Creating Accounts</strong></p>
<p>The first account you make during account registration is your one and only osu! account, from the moment of its creation and forevermore. This account is YOU. It is not anyone else - not your brother, your mother, your sister, your friend - it is YOU. Don’t share your account with anyone else. You don’t get to make a new one if you lose access to it. Keep it safe.<br>
Under no circumstances can one person own 2 accounts even if you plan to do nothing bad with the multiple account.<br>
If you lose access to your first account, contact Verge Support Team<br>
If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>
